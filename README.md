# Smart_Self_Defence_Device
Introduction:

Women in today's world are at risk of violence both in public and private spheres, in and around 
the home, in neighborhoods, and at the city level. Women experience a higher degree of insecurity 
which can restrict their access and use of the city. Eve teasing, sexual harassment, rape, domestic 
violence against women are the weapons used by the male to display male superiority. Other than 
this, the kidnapping of women, a girl, or a child happens in the world on the daily basis. In today's 
advanced world, the contribution of women in making the world advance is as equal as that of men. 
But still, in this advanced world, women can't step out of their houses at any given time due to 
physical or sexual abuse and a fear of violence. Because of this, many working women do not 
prefer to work at night. In spite, there are a lot of companies that work 24/7, in such cases, the ratio 
of women working at night is less. 
The safety of a person is always a major concern. Self-defense is a thing with which a person can 
defend themselves against the attackers. To defend oneself against anyone needs physical fitness. 
If in case, a person is not physically as strong as the attacker, then, it's tough for the person to 
defend against the attacker. As technology is getting faster, many protection responsibilities have 
been given over to innovative devices or gadgets. It gives a sense of safety to a person with some 
device that can help them in danger. Since the prediction of such a situation is not possible hence 
to minimize the act of physical violence is to keep all the help tools ready to safely escape from a 
violent situation. This reduces risk and brings help when needed. With the concern of this problem, 
we have come up with a device that would help a person defend themselves against attackers.
This device is completely autonomous and easy to use. It is a quick responding device, designed 
especially for women and child protection. When a person recognizes danger he/she needs to press 
the emergency key tightly, and the device will activate. GPS and GSM systems start tracking the 
exact location of the person; it also consists of a PIR sensor that can detect how many persons are 
present there and send all the information to the previously saved numbers and control rooms with 
an emergency message. With this device, one is able to escape from the attackers by giving a non-lethal electric shock. There is also a buzzer system that will continuously alert nearby people that 
a person is in danger so that he/she can get quick help. This device can remain to help the person 
even after getting defective, the vibrating sensor will send the keep going region in case the device 
gets abandoned.

Objective:

we are designing a device with different technology embedded inside it, that can 
help her for different cases:
1. This device can minimize the chances of the kidnapping of women, by alerting the victim's 
relative, nearby police control rooms, and nearby people so she can get quick help from any of 
them.
2. If in case, the situation is starting to become worse, she can escape thereby giving a non-lethal 
electric shock to the attackers.
3. Also, there may be a case, where someone will try to damage the device, or due to any reason, 
the device may get defected. In this case, the last location of the device will be sent to the 
previously saved numbers.
